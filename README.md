# mySQL-compare-schemas
A simple SQL script to compare two schemas on the same database. This is meant as a cross-check from a move from DEV to UAT. It does not create a difference script. This should be done as a part of ongoing best development practice. I recommend MySQLWorkbence to design the database and generate diffs files.
